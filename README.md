# win-inventory-tools
Windows scripts to generate reports from Windows (remote or local) workstations. It is intended to aid in the inventory of physical IT related equipment. It is strongly recommended using the Power Shell version (second one) as it is the most up to date.

## Visual Basic Script version

`pInven.vbs`: Generates a CSV file with *custom* columns (some are purposely blank; output file will be `hostname.csv`) with the following information: User, Part Number, Serial Number, Manufacturer, Model, RAM Memory, Processor and Operating System.

## Power Shell version
*This* is the one you should use

`pInven.ps1`: Behavior similar to the previous script, only with different columns and adapted to the current times.
